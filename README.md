# Photo Gallery Application implemented in Android Studios

This single-user Photo Gallery Application was coded in April 2024 for the course Software Methodology. It allows the storage and management of photos in one or more albums. This project is a follow-up from the Photo Gallery Application previously implemented in Java. 

Some of the features of this application include:
- An admin subsystem which allows the admin to create/delete users and view all users
- The non-admin subsystem which allows users to login and view all albums and photo information for this user from a previous session
- A user can then create/delete/rename photo albums, open an album which displays all photos, and search for photos
- After opening an album, the user can add/remove photos, caption/recaption photos, display the photo, add/delete tags from photos, or copy a photo to a different album
- The search function allows the user to search by date range and tag-value pairs
